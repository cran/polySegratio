To do's

Important: 
I need to check how arguments are set in S3 classes print, plot and
even split as there may be problems if they aren't in the right order:
see 7 Generic functions and methods of Writing Extensions
documentation - moved split.autoMarkers etc to divide.autoMarkers but
not sure about print.* 21/03/2007

Not so important:
Misclassification - more missed? so should I have more 1's that become
0's than vice versa - option 'missed.bands' in sim.autoMarkers and
sim.autoCross -  23/03/07
